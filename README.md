# Undergraudate-Capstone-Project
1. con_graph.py: This script generates convergence graphs for a reinforcement learning system with different user equipment (UE) counts.
2. dp_ex_graphic.py: This script creates a comparative energy efficiency plot
3. dqn_agent.py: Implements a Dueling DQN reinforcement learning agent with several parameters
4. env_test.py: A simple simulation environment using SimPy
5. metric_plot.py: Creates an error bar plot
6. multi_pannel.py: Generates a 2Ã—3 panel of bar charts showing action probability distributions across different UE counts (100-500).
